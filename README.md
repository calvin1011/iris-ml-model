# Machine Learning Models with Iris Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of three machine learning models using the classic **Iris dataset**:

1. **Classification Model** using Logistic Regression  
2. **Regression Model** using Linear Regression  
3. **Neural Network Model** using MLPClassifier (Multi-layer Perceptron)

Each model includes:
- A **train/test split** for evaluation
- **Predictions** on test data
- **Performance evaluation** using appropriate metrics

---

## Dataset Used

**Iris Dataset** from scikit-learn:
- 150 samples of iris flowers
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- Targets:
  - For classification: 3 iris species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)
  - For regression: Predicting petal width as a continuous value

---

## Files

- `iris_models.py`: Main script containing all three models
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `requirements.txt`: Project packages

---

## How to Run

1. Install required packages (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
````

2. Run the script:

```bash
python iris_models.py
```

## Model Descriptions

### 1. Classification Model – Logistic Regression

* Trained to predict flower species.
* Evaluated using **accuracy** and **classification report**.

### 2. Regression Model – Linear Regression

* Predicts **petal width** based on all other features.
* Evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

### 3. Neural Network – MLPClassifier

* A simple neural net with one hidden layer (10 neurons).
* Uses `'lbfgs'` solver for faster convergence.
* Evaluated using **accuracy** and **F1-score**.

## Sample Output

```
=== Classification (Logistic Regression) ===
Accuracy: 1.0

=== Regression (Predicting Petal Width) ===
MSE: 3.30e-32

=== Neural Network (MLPClassifier) ===
Accuracy: 0.977...
```

## Notes

* MLPClassifier might show a **ConvergenceWarning** if not fully trained, this can be adjusted by increasing `max_iter`.
* The models perform very well on the Iris dataset due to its simplicity and clear separability.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you demonstrate the ability to:

* Load and preprocess data
* Implement classification, regression, and neural networks
* Evaluate ML models using real-world metrics
